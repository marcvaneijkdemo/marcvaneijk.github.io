You might be totally new to GitHub, maybe you have already worked with it a little or you might even consider yourself a more advanced user and work with GitHub frequently. If you have looked at GitHub before you might have noticed that Microsoft is increasingly using it for multiple purposes. The documentation for Microsoft Azure is hosted on GitHub. This means that you are able to contribute to that documentation (in a controlled fashion of course). Besides documentation, you will also find a lot of GitHub repositories that contain code for interacting with different Microsoft products. A very good example of this is the azure-quickstart-templates repository.

https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates

This repository contains over 250 different deployment templates to use with Azure Resource Manager.
